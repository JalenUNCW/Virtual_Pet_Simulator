### Description ###
In this game, players adopt a virtual pet that requires regular care to stay happy and healthy. The pet has needs such as hunger, energy, hygiene, and happiness that players must manage. Players can interact with their pet by feeding it, playing games, putting it to sleep, taking it to vet appointments, and taking it for virtual walks. Over time, the pet’s needs change, and the player must keep it satisfied or risk losing points.

### Functionality ###
The pet has various status indicators (e.g., hunger, happiness, energy) that decrease over time or with certain actions. Players can perform different activities to keep these indicators balanced. For example, feeding the pet increases its hunger level, playing with the pet raises its happiness, and so on. The pet might also have age stages, allowing it to grow from a baby to an adult based on the player’s care. Rewards or badges can be awarded for reaching milestones like keeping the pet happy for a certain period.
